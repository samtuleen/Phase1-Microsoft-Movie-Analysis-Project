    "This analysis attempts to satisfy the informational needs of Microsoft (MSFT) by investigating the film industry to determine which types of films their new studio should produce. We will look at a number of factors to better understand what contributes to the success of a movie, and in turn offer a few recommendations on the best strategies to get started. Descriptive analysis of popular genres and ratings data show that while the preferred movie types that some people enjoy varies seasonally (think: horror films around Halloween and Christmas movies during the Christmas season), overall the three types of films that are currently doing the best are: . Microsoft can use this analysis to adjust planning, production, and marketing to hit the ground running as they enter this highly competitve space.\n"

    "Microsoft may be able to enter the movie making sector and successfully stand out from fierce competition by choosing to create films that their target audiences have shown to thoroughly enjoy. Doing so will allow them to produce movies that will instantly become hits, which will in turn allow them to improve on and produce even more content, setting them up to be a studio force to be reckoned with. Using data from well-known industry sources such as Imdb, I analyze and explain patterns in popular movie types based on ratings and reviews, as well as budgeting decisions to help predict what audiences want from a film and thus guaranteeing its success."

    "Rotten Tomatoes is a well-known review-aggregation website for television and film. Due to its frequent use by the American public, it is widely viewed as the 'go-to' in deciding whether or not a movie or show is worth watching. IMDB.com is a database that is considered the most authoritative source for all film and television related material. The data from both websites provide information such as, but not limited to, reviews and ratings.\n",
