Descriptive analysis of popular genres and outcome data show that while the preferred movie types that some people enjoy varies seasonally (think: horror films around Halloween and Christmas movies during the Christmas season), overall the three types of films that are currently doing the best are: . Microsoft can use this analysis to adjust planning, production, and marketing to hit the ground running as they enter this highly competitve space."

Doing so will allow Microsoft to produce movies that will instantly become hits, which will in turn allow them to improve on and produce even more content, setting them up to be a studio force to be reckoned with.
