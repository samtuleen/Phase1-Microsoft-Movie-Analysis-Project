    "This project analyzes and attempts to satisfy the informational needs of Microsoft (MSFT) to determine which types of films their new studio should produce. Descriptive analysis of popular genres and outcome data shows that while the preferred movie types that some people enjoy varies seasonally (think: horror films around Halloween and Christmas movies during the Christmas season), overall the three types of films that are currently doing the best are . Microsoft can use this analysis to adjust outreach, planning, and production to hit the ground running as they enter this highly competitve space."

    "Microsoft may be able to enter the movie making sector and successfully stand out from fierce competition by choosing to create films that their target audiences have shown to thoroughly enjoy. Doing so will allow Microsoft to produce movies that will instantly become hits, which will in turn allow them to improve on and produce even more content, setting them up to be a studio force to be reckoned with. Using data from well-known industry sources such as IMDB, I analyze and explain patterns in popular movie types based on ratings and reviews.\n",
